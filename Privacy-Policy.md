# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-08-13

This Activity does not collect, store, or share any personal information. (Can you believe that? Something in current year that doesn't collect info?? Woah!)

All game data required for operation is handled locally within your Discord client and is never transmitted anywhere.

The game will store save data locally. If you use your actual name as your save file name, that's on you.

The Activity does not use cookies, analytics, or any external tracking. (Wow, shocker.)

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy (how would you have any), you can contact the developer (Yuriko) of this Activity via her Discord account (yuriko.shimizu). (Although she would prefer if you didn't.)
